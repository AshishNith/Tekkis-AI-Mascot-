# Tekkie — AI mascot

A playful 3D AI buddy that floats over your screen and talks with you in real time.
This repo is built step by step; see [`docs/PLAN.md`](docs/PLAN.md) for decisions and roadmap.

**Step 1 (this commit):** a 3D Tekkie character with realtime voice conversation.

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
```

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Add your Gemini API key (from https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to `.env` as `GEMINI_API_KEY`, then:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173, tap Tekkie (or press **Talk**), allow the microphone and start talking.
Headphones give the best experience (no echo).

To check which realtime models your key can use:

```bash
npm run models -w server
```

### Production build

```bash
npm run build && npm start
```

The server then serves the built site and the API on `PORT` (default 8787).

## How it works

```
Browser (apps/web)                         Server (server/)                 Google
──────────────────                         ────────────────                 ──────
Tekkie widget ── POST /api/live-token ───► mints 1-use ephemeral token ──► Gemini API
     │                                     (model, voice, persona locked)
     └── WebSocket (mic 16 kHz PCM ⇄ voice 24 kHz PCM) ─────────────────► Gemini Live
```

- The real API key never leaves the server. The browser gets a single-use token that expires
  in a minute if unused and that can only open a Tekkie session (model, voice and persona locked).
- Audio streams directly between the browser and Gemini, so the server stays tiny and cheap.
- The token endpoint is rate-limited per IP and only accepts allowed origins (`ALLOWED_ORIGINS`).

## Project layout

| Path | What |
|---|---|
| `apps/web/src/mascot/TekkieCharacter.ts` | The 3D character (Three.js): hover, blink, cursor-follow, lip sync, wave, states |
| `apps/web/src/mascot/skins.ts` | Skins as data (colours + accessory) — basis for the skins store |
| `apps/web/src/voice/LiveVoiceSession.ts` | Realtime conversation with Gemini Live: states, captions, interruptions |
| `apps/web/src/voice/audio.ts`, `pcm-capture-worklet.js` | Mic capture (16 kHz PCM) and gap-free playback with loudness for lip sync |
| `apps/web/src/widget/` | Floating, draggable widget in a Shadow DOM (safe to drop on any site) |
| `server/src/` | Token server, Tekkie's persona, model listing script |

## Tekkie's states

The antenna shows what Tekkie is doing: **green** listening · **yellow** thinking/connecting ·
**skin glow** talking · **red** error.
